# examining_twins_and_supermag
Initial examination of the TWINS Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) data in relation to the ground magnetometer data from the SuperMAG network. This work will inform future studies on the use of ENA data for predicting large ground magnetic field perturbations.

# This is not a polished repository!
If you are reading this before the publication of these materials then you are looking at a repository that has not been polished and cleaned up. Many of these files are redundant or irrelivant to the final project. I continue to publish this repository and other working repositories because science is a dynamic and sometimes messy process, and I feel as though it's important to reflect that in how we present ourselves to the world. Likewise, this repository is messy, unfinished in it's current form and constantly changing, and most likely will be so until it is part of a published work. In the mean time, if you are coming across this and feel confused, or just generally don't understand something please feel free to reach out to me!
