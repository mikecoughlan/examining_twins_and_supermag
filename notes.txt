Notes for the auto-encoder:

Still a lot of hyperparameter tuning to do. But the model works overall. Will attempt to do a Baysiean
optimaization technique or some of the automatic hyperparameter tuning. Still need to figure out how to
properly adjust the layers such that they reproduce the initial image dimensions for the loss calculations
without me having to manually do some math on the strides and filter sizes to get the dimensions right.

Version Descriptions:
    v0: Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', strides=1, padding='same')
